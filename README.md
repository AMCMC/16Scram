snakemake pipeline to convert 16S amplicon data to ASV mapped cram format in order to reduce space.
Size reduction of ~40%. with V4 amplicon (which has 100% R1 R2 overlap)

!Note headers of fastq are trimmed so index information is lost.

!Higher efficiency could be achieved with merged sample sets

!Could be used per project
